# 42-H2S-OOP_Introduction

A introductory to OOP projects for high schoolers

It consist of six exercises for students to really practice.

Ex00: Make your first class with a constructor that says "Hello World". You must instanciate your first class only in a main

Ex01: Make your second class that will inherit from the first class and call the first class constructor that says "Hello World". You must instanciate the second class only in your main.

Ex02: You now need your second class to take a parameter "name" (which will be your login name) and pass it into the first class which will display "Hello ". You must instanciate the second class only in your main.

Ex03: You now need to create a method inside your first class called Hello which will take the name from the constructor and print out "Hello ". When the method is call put some sort of output for identification. You must instanciate the second class only in your main.

Ex04: You now need to create a method inside your second class called number which will randomly generate a number from 1 to 6. It than will pass it to Hello method in first class which will print out "Hello , your number is ". When any method is called it must put some sort of output for itself. You must instanciate the second class only in your main.

Ex05: Your second class will now take a second parameter called hobby and it must be stored as a variable. You will write a method called getHobby in your second class that returns this variable. In your main you need to print out "Your hobby is " where must be returned from the getHobby method. You must instanciate the second class only in your main.
